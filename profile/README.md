# Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ Welcome to the **Skylead Technologies** organization!<br/><br/>

## Developer team split
Our developer team is separated into 3 smaller teams:<br/>
- **Frontend team** - Main dashboard development, wordpress websites and frontend of our backoffice.
- **Worker team** - The functional core of our system. This includes our workers, schedulers and scripts regarding the general linkedin and email task schedule and execution as well as some periodically called scripts.
- **Backend team** - Here are our main API services made. It includes our main backend, the backend of the backoffice, Open API and Email integration.

## Team meetings
All teams have separated team meetings with the same meeting structure.<br/>
- **[Daily meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G1ryt2GO0L4CoMyc5nh-qbJcTFgYcdNlowzQ5bixYVA/edit#)** - every weekday (Monday to Friday except every other Wednesday)
- **[Planning meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cy5fId6c4TyTE77zQBp0W23LUYIZ2_OAWEgRupiOvPM)** - every other Wednesday

The meeting timing depends on the team you are in.
All the events are **added into your google calendar** connected with your **skylead email**, so you can check for the exact timing there, depending on your timezone.

For every planning, we are taking a track of all thing regarding processes that our developer have complained about are or will be improved. Feel free to take a look at it:  [All retrospectives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--vGek5QQOgvR9kINmTNF_rkgd28OQjjvY0ELljNijk)
