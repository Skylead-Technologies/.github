## Developer team split
Our developer team is separated into 3 smaller teams:<br/>
- **Frontend team** - Main dashboard development, wordpress websites and frontend of our backoffice.
- **Worker team** - The functional core of our system. This includes our workers, schedulers and scripts regarding the general linkedin and email task schedule and execution as well as some periodically called scripts.
- **Backend team** - Here are our main API services made. It includes our main backend, the backend of the backoffice, Open API and Email integration.

## Team meetings
All teams have separated team meetings with the same meeting structure.<br/>
- **[Daily meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G1ryt2GO0L4CoMyc5nh-qbJcTFgYcdNlowzQ5bixYVA/edit#)** - every weekday (Monday to Friday except every other Wednesday)
- **[Planning meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cy5fId6c4TyTE77zQBp0W23LUYIZ2_OAWEgRupiOvPM)** - every other Wednesday

<br />

The meeting timing depends on the team you are in.
All the events are **added into your google calendar** connected with your **skylead email**, so you can check for the exact timing there, depending on your timezone. <br/>
Every event has the **google meet link** attached for those who are joining it online.

<br />

Please, make sure that: 
- **You are not late** - Everyone's time is valuable, so let’s treat it as such. ⌛
- **You don’t get too comfy** - Let’s make it a short, effective meeting for everyone. 
- **You are not rambling** - Be as clear and concise as possible. Remain mindful of the limited time allotted to you and other team members. 
- **You are listening** - Stay focused. You might have a solution to your teammate's obstacles and it would be great to share it! 💡
- **You avoid 1-on-1 conversations** - It's a team meeting, and we’ll all be more efficient if we leave back-and-forth conversations after the meeting.
